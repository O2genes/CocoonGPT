HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY (HBOT) - BASIC KNOWLEDGE
==================================================

DEFINITION AND FUNDAMENTALS
---------------------------
Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is a medical treatment involving breathing 100% oxygen at pressures higher than normal atmospheric pressure (1 ATA). Treatment typically occurs at 1.5-3.0 ATA in specialized chambers.

Normal atmospheric pressure at sea level = 1.0 ATA (Atmosphere Absolute)
Therapeutic pressure range = 1.5-2.5 ATA for most conditions
Maximum therapeutic pressure = 3.0 ATA for specific emergencies

BASIC PHYSICS
-------------
• Boyle's Law: At constant temperature, gas volume is inversely proportional to pressure
• Henry's Law: Gas solubility in liquid increases with pressure
• Dalton's Law: Total pressure equals sum of partial pressures

At 2.0 ATA breathing 100% oxygen:
- Oxygen partial pressure = 2.0 ATA (vs 0.21 ATA at sea level)
- Blood oxygen content increases 15-20 fold
- Tissues receive oxygen via plasma diffusion, not just hemoglobin

PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS
------------------------
1. HYPEROXIA EFFECTS
   - Increased oxygen dissolved in plasma
   - Enhanced oxygen delivery to poorly perfused tissues
   - Oxygen can reach areas with compromised blood flow

2. VASOCONSTRICTION
   - Reduces edema and swelling
   - Maintains tissue oxygenation despite reduced blood flow
   - Helps control bleeding

3. ENHANCED IMMUNE FUNCTION
   - Improves white blood cell bactericidal activity
   - Enhances antibiotic effectiveness
   - Stimulates growth factors

4. ANGIOGENESIS
   - Promotes new blood vessel formation
   - Releases vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
   - Improves long-term tissue perfusion

5. COLLAGEN SYNTHESIS
   - Essential for wound healing
   - Requires adequate oxygen levels
   - Enhanced under hyperoxic conditions
