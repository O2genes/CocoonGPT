HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY SAFETY GUIDELINES
==========================================

CRITICAL SAFETY OVERVIEW
------------------------
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves breathing 100% oxygen at increased atmospheric pressure. While generally safe when properly administered, HBOT requires strict adherence to safety protocols due to fire risk in oxygen-enriched environments and potential for pressure-related injuries.

ABSOLUTE CONTRAINDICATIONS
--------------------------
These conditions prohibit HBOT treatment entirely:

1. UNTREATED PNEUMOTHORAX
   - Collapsed lung that has not been treated
   - Risk of tension pneumothorax during decompression
   - Requires chest tube placement before HBOT

2. CERTAIN CHEMOTHERAPY DRUGS
   - Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) - current or recent use
   - Cisplatin - increases pulmonary toxicity risk
   - Bleomycin - significant pulmonary fibrosis risk

   - Requires arterial blood gas analysis
   - May need modified protocols

3. ACTIVE UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS
   - Difficulty equalizing ear pressure
