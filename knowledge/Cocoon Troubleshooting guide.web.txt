	There are hairline cracks on the plexiglass door
	Do not be alarmed. It is normal and common to see surface hairline cracks on the plexiglass door. O2genes team conducts periodic checks and tests to ensure your safety and the cocoon satisfies pressure vessel human occupancy requirements.
	Continue to monitor the hairline cracks. If it expands to be more obvious or concerning, contact our o2genes team for an adhoc service and on-site check to be safe and sure. We take safety seriously and will do our part to ensure safety.
